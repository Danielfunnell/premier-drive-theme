                        <p>You will learn with a professional fully qualified local Ashford driving instructor with over 15 years experience, unlike some driving schools that use trainees whom may have very little experience. My main priority when teaching all pupils to drive is to be patient and to create a calm relaxing atmosphere in the car ideal for more enjoyable driving lessons and quicker learning.</p>

                        <p>Your lessons will be structured and designed to suit your skill level, whether it is your first time driving or if you are an experienced learner.  Every driving lesson is recorded and monitored in your drivers record, which will be given to you on your first lesson. The drivers record is a syllabus designed to help you and your driving instructor keep a record of your progress while you are learning to drive, basically it lets you know where you stand. The duration and regularity of your driving lessons depends on you, however we recommend a 2 hour lesson once a week to keep you learning at a good pace</p>
